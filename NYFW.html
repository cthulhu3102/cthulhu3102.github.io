      <h1>Guide to the New York fashion week</h1>
      <p>New York Fashion Week, held in February and September of each year, is a semi-annual series of events when international fashion collections are shown to buyers, the press, and the general public. Held in February and September of each year, is a semi-annual series of events (generally lasting 79 days) when international fashion collections are shown to buyers, the press, and the general public. It is one of four major fashion weeks in the world, collectively known as the "Big 4," along with those in Paris, London and Milan.The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) created the modern notion of a centralized New York Fashion Week in 1993, although cities like London were already using their citys name in conjunction with the words fashion week in the 1980s. NYFW is based on a much older series of events called Press Week, founded in 1943.</p>

<h2>What to dress</h2>
<p>Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don't you'll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines. Also it's important to wear shoes you'll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
